I'm a computer science, math, and physics student at Columbia University, particularly interested in machine learning and plasma physics. I will try to update this site with my latest projects and instructional tutorials about machine learning and cool math topics. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

### Projects

*Disclaimer:* I will try to keep this list updated, but please check my github for my latest projects. 

My latest machine learning projects include a general-purpose char-RNN for learning from and interpreting text, a set of generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and several face datasets, a number of deep classifiers on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and the ILSVRC datasets, and finally an object localization network trained on ImageNet. Other side-projects include various sanitization utilities for images and text, and some curiosities like a Mandelbrot generator and some scientific visualization datasets.
