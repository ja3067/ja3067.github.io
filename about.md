I'm a third year undergraduate in computer science, math, and physics at Columbia University. I'm a researcher at the Columbia Data Science Institute, a teaching assistant in the Columbia Math and CS departments, and a classical musician with the Columbia Music Performance Program.

There are few things more exciting or potentially revolutionary than machine learning right now, and I'm trying to get involved and contribute to that revolution. I also want to make the process of learning how to use machine learning tools easier, and I will try to update this site with my latest projects and instructional tutorials about machine learning and cool math topics. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

### Internships

* **Machine Learning Researcher** at the Columbia Data Science Institute (May 2018 - Present)
  - Studied self-replication in artificial intelligence and machine learning, including self-replicating deep neural networks and their potential applications to biology and AI.
  - Currently writing several papers on our state of the art results.

* **C++ and CUDA Software Engineer** at the Columbia Creative Machines Lab (May 2018 - September 2018)
  - Created the Titan Simulation Library, an NVIDIA CUDA-based library which outperforms all existing CPU-based implementations on spring/mass physics simulations.
  - Applied the library to robotics and evolutionary algorithms problems throughout the lab.

* **Undergraduate Researcher** at the Columbia Plasma Physics Laboratory (May 2017 - Present) 
  - Writing software which performs computational simulations of stellarator fusion reactors in C++, Python, and FORTRAN, and designing circuits for the main reactor field coils in LTSpice (and, god forbid, on a breadboard).
  - Writing a Python API for large segments of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) FORTRAN VMEC library, and implementing custom optimization software for finding plasma volume extrema.
  - Using Labview and C to write real-time control software for stabilizing high currents in the stellarator field coils.

* **Research Assistant** in the Barnard Chemistry Department (Fall 2015 - Present)
  - Mass spectrometry, florescent microscopy, and computational data analysis in a biochemistry/neurochemistry setting.
  - Trained a neural network to perform clustering and colocalization analysis on florescent microscopy samples of mice brain tissue.
  - Analyzed and sanitized data in R and Pandas.

### Other Experience

* Teaching Assistant, COMS 4771 Machine Learning, MATH 3027 Ordinary Differential Equations, MATH 3028 Partial Differential Equations.
* Aerodynamics and Software Team Lead for the Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) NASA high-efficiency flight challenge team. 1st Prize Winner for the 2017 NASA Langley aircraft design competition. 
* Member of the Columbia Society of Physics Students (SPS), and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) and computer aided design (CAD) instructor at Columbia.
* Classical pianist and chamber musician, who has performed at Carnegie Hall and Symphony Space in NYC.

### Kaggle Competitions:

* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/leaderboard">**MNIST Digit Recognizer:**</a> A simple hand-written digit recognition challenge using the MNIST dataset. My deep convolution network achieved 98.957% accuracy, well above human accuracy, placing it in the top third of all submissions as of 7/22/2017. 

* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/leaderboard">**Cats & Dogs Redux Classification:**</a> An amusing Kaggle challenge, competiters were tasked to distinguish between cats and dogs in several hundred thousand images. My model achieve a loss of .46, placing it in the top half of all submissions.

* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/leaderboard">**CIFAR-10 Classification:**</a> A classification challenge on the classic CIFAR-10 dataset of color images. 10 class, tens of thousands of images. My first model achieved a loss of 0.75810, placing it in the top half of all submissions.
