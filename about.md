I'm a second year undergraduate in computer science, math, and physics at Columbia University. I'm really interested in machine learning and plasma physics, but I also love math and am trying to squeeze a minor or major in. 

There are few things more exciting or potentially revolutionary than machine learning right now, and I'm trying to get involved and contribute to that revolution however I can. I also want to make the process of learning how to use machine learning tools easier, and I will try to update this site with my latest projects and instructional tutorials about machine learning and cool math topics. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

### Internships

* **Undergraduate Researcher** at the Columbia Plasma Physics Laboratory (May 2017 - Present) 
  - Writing software which performs computational simulations of stellarator fusion reactors in C++, Python, and FORTRAN, and designing circuits for the main reactor field coils in LTSpice (and, god forbid, on a breadboard).
  - Writing a Python API for large segments of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) FORTRAN VMEC library, and implementing custom optimization software for finding plasma volume extrema.
  - Using Labview and C to write real-time control software for stabilizing high currents in the stellarator field coils,
  
* **Research Assistant** in the Barnard Chemistry Department (Fall 2015 - Present)
  - Mass spectrometry, florescent microscopy, and computational data analysis in a biochemistry/neurochemistry setting.
  - Learned a great deal of bio and neurochemistry, and trained a neural network to perform clustering a colocalization analysis on florescent microscopy samples.
  - Exposure to R and Pandas.

### Other Experience

* Aerodynamics Team Lead for the Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) NASA high-efficiency flight challenge team.
* Member of the Columbia Society of Physics Students (SPS), and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) and computer aided design (CAD) instructor at Columbia.
* Classical pianist and chamber musician, who has performed at Carnegie Hall and Symphony Space in NYC.
