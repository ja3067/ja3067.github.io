I'm a fourth year undergraduate in computer science and mathematics at Columbia University. I'm a researcher at the Columbia Data Science Institute, a teaching assistant in the Columbia Math and CS departments, and a classical musician with the Columbia Music Performance Program. This past summer I worked at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

I am interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, and classical music. I am one of the authors of the Coral programming language and compiler, as well as the Titan simulation library.

### Internships

<div class="extra_padding_li" markdown="1">
* **Machine Learning and Software Engineering Intern** at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (May 2019 - August 2019)
  - Built the NASA GPU Data Visualization library for processing and analyzing NASA climate data using GPUs.
  - Winner of the 2019 NASA Data Visualization and Storytelling Competition Grand Prize for the data visualization and machine learning work.

* **Machine Learning Researcher** at the Columbia Data Science Institute (May 2018 - Present)
  - Studied self-replication in artificial intelligence and machine learning, including self-replicating deep neural networks and their potential applications to biology and AI.
  - Currently writing several papers on our state of the art results.

* **C++ and CUDA Software Engineer** at the Columbia Creative Machines Lab (May 2018 - September 2018)
  - Created the Titan Simulation Library, an NVIDIA CUDA-based library which outperforms all existing CPU-based implementations on spring/mass physics simulations.
  - Applied the library to robotics and evolutionary algorithms problems throughout the lab.

* **Undergraduate Researcher** at the Columbia Plasma Physics Laboratory (May 2017 - Present) 
  - Writing software which performs computational simulations of stellarator fusion reactors in C++, Python, and FORTRAN, and designing circuits for the main reactor field coils in LTSpice (and, god forbid, on a breadboard).
  - Writing a Python API for large segments of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) FORTRAN VMEC library, and implementing custom optimization software for finding plasma volume extrema.
  - Using Labview and C to write real-time control software for stabilizing high currents in the stellarator field coils.
  
* **Research Assistant** in the Barnard Chemistry Department (Fall 2015 - Present)
  - Mass spectrometry, florescent microscopy, and computational data analysis in a biochemistry/neurochemistry setting.
  - Trained a neural network to perform clustering and colocalization analysis on florescent microscopy samples of mice brain tissue.
  - Analyzed and sanitized data in R and Pandas.
