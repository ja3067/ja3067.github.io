title: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Done Right
excerpt: 
---

To the extent that coolness matters in Machine Learning, Generative adversarial networks, or GANs, are about as cool as it gets. The idea of pitting neural networks against one another, and ending up with vastly better outcomes as a result, is an absurd idea, but it doesn't just work, it can produce some of the most bizarre and profound results of any neural network. 

The first paper on the subject was the 2015 [Fergus *et al*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5773-deep-generative-image-models-using-a-laplacian-pyramid-of-adversarial-networks.pdf), and since then, teams have use adversarial networks to [enhance images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf%C3%AF%C2%BC%E2%80%B0)(CSI, here we come), generate faces, and write sequences of handwritten letters. Not only are GANs extremely powerful, the idea behind them is very easy to understand.
