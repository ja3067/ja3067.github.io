title: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Done Right
excerpt: 
---

To the extent that coolness matters in Machine Learning, Generative adversarial networks, or GANs, are about as cool as it gets. The idea of pitting neural networks against one another, and ending up with vastly better outcomes as a result, is an absurd idea, but it works - and when it works, it works beautifully.

The first paper on the subject was the 2015 [Fergus *et al*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5773-deep-generative-image-models-using-a-laplacian-pyramid-of-adversarial-networks.pdf), and since then, teams have use adversarial networks to [enhance images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf%C3%AF%C2%BC%E2%80%B0)(CSI, here we come), generate faces, and write sequences of handwritten letters. The famous AlphaGo AI from Google DeepMind used a sort of adversarial network to perform reinforcement learning, playing millions of games against previous states of itself. I hope these examples can make you appreciate how powerful they are, but it's another thing to really understand how they work. Thankfully, the basic concept is quite easy to grasp.
