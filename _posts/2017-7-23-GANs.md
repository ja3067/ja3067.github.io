title: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Done Right
---

To the extent that coolness matters in Machine Learning, Generative adversarial networks, or GANs, are about as cool as it gets. The idea of pitting neural networks against one another, and ending up with vastly better outcomes as a result, is such an absurd idea, it captivated me as soon as I read some of the early papers, like the the 2015 [Fergus *et al*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5773-deep-generative-image-models-using-a-laplacian-pyramid-of-adversarial-networks.pdf). Since then, teams have use adversarial networks to [enhance images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf%C3%AF%C2%BC%E2%80%B0)(CSI, here we come), generate faces, and write sequences of handwritten letters. And not only are GANs extremely powerful, the idea behind them is very easy to understand.
