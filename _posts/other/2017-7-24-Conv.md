title: "Back to Basics: Convolution Networks and MNIST"

The MNIST dataset is one of the oldest and best known in Machine Learning. It's everyone's first real dataset, and it's satisfying as hell to predict the often bizarelly contorted letters with uncanny accuracy. In this post, I'd like to go step by step through the process of designing and training an MNIST classifier in Tensorflow, while delving into some of the more technical/mathamtical details that are often ignored.
